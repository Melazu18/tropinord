            <p>
              TropiNord is more than just a brand â€” itâ€™s a journey that brings
              together the rich traditions of the tropics with the clean,
              conscious lifestyle of the Nordic region.
            </p>
            <p>
              Founded in Sweden by Paul Abejegah, TropiNord was inspired by
              personal experiences across Nigeria, the Fiji Islands, Vanuatu,
              and Sweden. Having lived in diverse cultures and communities, Paul
              witnessed both the beauty of nature in its raw form and the
              potential to share it with others in a meaningful way.
            </p>
            <p>
              TropiNord began with a simple belief: that natural products should
              be honest, sustainable, and rooted in real stories. Today, itâ€™s a
              growing platform for organic wellness, cultural connection, and
              sustainable trade.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              We exist to make natural living accessible, trustworthy, and
              globally connected. Our mission is to provide:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>
                Pure, organic oils and soaps made from traditional ingredients
              </li>
              <li>
                Ethical and sustainable product sourcing that supports small
                producers
              </li>
              <li>
                A bridge between cultures â€” connecting African heritage with
                Nordic quality
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We want our customers to feel confident not just in what they buy,
              but in why they buy it.

              Our Roots & Sourcing
            </h2>
            <p>
              At TropiNord, we carefully select our ingredients and partners. We
              work with small-scale producers in Africa, the South Pacific, and
              other tropical regions to source raw, high-quality ingredients
              like:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Coconut oil</li>
              <li>Almond oil</li>
              <li>Shea butter</li>
              <li>Black soap</li>
              <li>Neem, hibiscus, turmeric, and more</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Our focus is on ethical sourcing, fair pricing, and transparency â€”
              because how something is made matters just as much as the product
              itself.
